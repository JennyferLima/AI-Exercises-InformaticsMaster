# AI-Exercises-InformaticsMaster (PPGI - UFAL)

## Mastering-AI-Challenges-From-Medical-Diagnosis-to-Decision-Trees-and-Beyond

This repository contains the proposed solutions for the exercise list of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) course taught by Professor Evandro Barros and Xu Yang at the Graduate Program in Informatics (PPGI) of the Federal University of Alagoas (UFAL).

## Objective

The exercise list aims to explore different techniques and tools in Artificial Intelligence, including knowledge-based systems, fuzzy logic, Bayesian networks, case-based reasoning, among others. Each problem presented addresses a specific challenge in applying AI techniques to solve real-world problems.

## Repository Structure

- Problems: Contains the statements of each problem proposed by Professor Evandro Barros and Xu Yang.

- Solutions: Each problem has a corresponding folder with its solution in Python.

*Please note that the description of each problem is available in the Python documentation itself, at the beginning of each file.* 

## Development of Solutions

The solutions were developed based on the knowledge acquired in the AI course of PPGI UFAL, using state-of-the-art techniques and tools in AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science. Each problem was addressed in detail, following the guidelines of Professor Evandro Barros and the best practices in the field.

## Scoring

Each part of the exercise list, both Part 1 and Part 2, has a score assigned, ranging from 0 to 5 points, as specified by Professor Evandro Barros.
